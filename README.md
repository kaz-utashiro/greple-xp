# NAME

App::Greple::xp - extended pattern module

# VERSION

Version 0.04

# SYNOPSIS

greple -Mxp

# DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions those can be used by **greple** pattern
and region options.

# OPTIONS

- **--le-pattern** _file_
- **--inside-pattern** _file_
- **--outside-pattern** _file_
- **--include-pattern** _file_
- **--exclude-pattern** _file_

    Read file contents and use each lines as a pattern for options.

- **--le-string** _file_
- **--inside-string** _file_
- **--outside-string** _file_
- **--include-string** _file_
- **--exclude-string** _file_

    Almost same as **\*-pattern** option but each line is concidered as a
    fixed string rather than regular expression.

## COMMENT

You can insert comment lines in pattern file.  As for fixed string
file, there is no way to write comment.

Lines start with hash mark (`#`) is ignored as a comment line.

String after double slash (`//`) is also ignored with preceding
spaces.

## WILD CARD

Because _file_ parameter is globbed, you can use wild card to give
multiple files.  If nothing matched to the wild card, this option is
simply ignored with no message.

    $ greple -Mxp --exclude-pattern '*.exclude' ...
